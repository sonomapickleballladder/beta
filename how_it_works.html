<h3  id="Signing-up">Signing up:</h3>
<ul>
<li><i>New signups are currenty disabled for this trial phase. If you are seeing this and are hoping to join, you will be able to do so once the ladder officially starts.</i></li>
<hide>
<li>You can <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/UUK-IJVmVUmn1s1p9a+ikKJrn4OfZeGx2dEEwevjTw0/">sign up</a> at anytime.</li>
<li>You will placed at the bottom of the ladder upon doing so (though players with higher ratings who sign up the same week will have priority as far as seedings go).</li>
<li>You will have to wait to play until the next week starts (or sometimes the week after that, if you end up being one of lowest 3 seeds and the number of players available is not a multiple of 4).</li>
</hide>
</ul>
<h3 id="Frequency">Frequency:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Play occurs once per week.</li>
<li><mark>Sunday at 9:00 PM marks the end of each week and the beginning of the next.</mark></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Default-playing-time">Default playing time:</h3>
<ul>
<li><mark>Sunday from 2:00 to 4:00 PM</mark>.</li>
</ul>
<h3  id="Confirming-availability">Confirming availability:</h3>
<ul>
<li><mark>You must be able to make the <a href="#Default-playing-time"> default playing time</a> in order to be considered available each week, and you must confirm that you are available for the following week before the end of each week</mark>.</li>
<li><mark style="background:lightgreen">You can do so by typing <b><i>'yes'</i></b> in the appropriate cell (the one which corresponds to your name and the week for which you are confirming availability) in the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://cryptpad.fr/sheet/#/2/sheet/edit/jLkTB9gf0+b3zxSvfbxH9HQq/embed/">the confirmations spreadsheet</a>, or by emailing <a href="mailto:SPLconfirmations@riseup.net?subject=Yes&body=Confirming%20that%20I%20am%20at%20least%20available%20Sunday%20from%202:00%20-%204:00%20PM%20this%20coming%20week...">SPLconfirmations@riseup.net</a></mark>.</li>
<li><mark>If you do not confirm that you are available by the deadline, you will not play that week. Every week you do not confirm, you move down two places in the rankings.</mark></li>
</ul>
<h3  id="Groupings">Groupings:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Players will be grouped in groups of 4 at the start of each week. These are determined by rankings and availability. Group 1 will be comprised of the top 4 available players. Group 2 will be the next 4, and so on.</li>
<li><mark>Groupings can be found on the <a target="_blank" href="groups.html">Groups Page</a>, as well as in the <u>'Players Playing'</u> row in the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://cryptpad.fr/sheet/#/2/sheet/edit/gaQQWS-YwgSKxdHOxlqUWkRt/embed/">the spreadsheet</a>. Look for them to be updated every Monday</mark>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Scheduling">Scheduling:</h3>
<ul>
<li><mark>As soon as the groups have been posted each week, you are welcome (and strongly encouraged) to contact the other players in your group (see <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://cryptpad.fr/sheet/#/2/sheet/view/k7U3auRo73AaaHKxXzYDQIUEq+04eb27Cg0Akxis9PU/embed/">contact information page</a>) and arrange when and where to play</mark>.</li>
<li><mark style="background:cyan">If your group does not do so, you will play at Finley Park at <a href="#Default-playing-time">the default time</a></mark>.</li>
</ul>
<h3  id="Format">Format:</h3>
<ul>
<li><mark>Round-robin, 3 games to 15, switch at 8 each game. </mark><mark id="order" style="background:salmon;">The #1 seed shall play with the #4 seed first game, then with the #3 seed, and lastly with the #2 seed. </mark>
<mark>If all 4 players in your group agree to it, you may play 3 games to 11, 6 games to 11, or 6 games to 15. If you choose to do 6 games, play in the <a href="#order">same specified order</a>, before repeating the sequence, and play on the opposite side of the court the second time you play with the same person.</mark></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Ball">Ball:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dura Fast 40.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Unforseen-circumstances">Unforseen circumstances:</h3>
<ul>
<li>If one or more players in a group get sick, injured, or are otherwise unable to play due to exceptional circumstances, the remaining players can choose not to play that week (in which case their positions in the standings will be unaffected), or they may opt to bring in a sub (or multiple subs if necessary).</li>
<li>The sub should be at a similar level, but their scores will not count and they do not have to be signed up for the ladder. Groups that end up playing with a sub should write <code style="background:beige;font-size:60%;">Sub: Game 1 score, Game 2 score, etc...</code> when <a href="#Submitting-your-scores">submitting scores</a> by email, and <s>strike-through</s> the name of the player(s) unable to play if they are entering them into the spreadsheet. </li>
</ul>
<h3  id="Submitting-your-scores">Submitting your scores:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Keep track of the game scores as you play and make sure everyone in your group agrees with them at the end.</li>
<li><mark>It is your group's responsibility to enter them into <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://cryptpad.fr/sheet/#/2/sheet/edit/gaQQWS-YwgSKxdHOxlqUWkRt/embed/">the spreadsheet</a> (or, alternatively, email them to <a href="mailto:SPLscoresubmissions@riseup.net?subject=Scores">SPLscoresubmissions@riseup.net</a>) before the end of each week</mark>. If you email them, you can format it like this: <br>
<code style="background:beige;font-size:60%;">Player 1 Name: Game 1 score, Game 2 score, etc...<br>Player 2 Name: Game 1 score, Game 2 score, etc...<br>Player 3 Name: Game 1 score, Game 2 score, etc...<br>Player 4 Name: Game 1 score, Game 2 score, etc...<br> </code> </li>
<li>Failure to do so will result in all players in the group dropping two ranking spots.</li>
</ul>
<h3  id="Moving-up-or-down">Moving up or down:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You win(/lose) your group by having the highest(/lowest) point differential (points won â€“ points lost).</li>
<li>In theory, the winner of each group would become the fourth/lowest seed in the group above, while the loser would assume the highest position in the group below. The other two players would remain in the same group, though their seedings might change based on how they do relative to each other. However, this will not always be the case, if any higher ranked players are absent that week. </li>
</ul>
<h3  id="Note">Note:</h3>
<ul>
<li><mark>This ladder is currently in a pilot phase. As such, its structure and format may be tweaked at any time.</mark> Please feel free to send any questions, feedback, or suggestions for improvements to <a href="mailto:SPLinfo@riseup.net">SPLinfo@riseup.net</a>.</li>
