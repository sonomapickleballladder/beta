      <h3 id="Frequency">Frequency:</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>Play occurs once per week.</li>
      <li><mark>Sunday at 9:00 PM marks the end of each week and the beginning of the next.</mark></li>
      </ul>
      <h3  id="Signing-up">Signing up:</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>You can <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/UUK-IJVmVUmn1s1p9a+ikKJrn4OfZeGx2dEEwevjTw0/">sign up</a> at anytime.</li>
      <li>You will placed at the bottom of the ladder upon doing so (though players with higher ratings who sign up the same week will have priority as far as seedings go).</li>
      <li>You will have to wait to play until the next week starts (or sometimes the week after that, if you end up being one of lowest 3 seeds and the number of players available is not a multiple of 4).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3  id="Confirming-availability">Confirming availability:</h3>
      <ul>
      <li><mark>You must confirm that you are in for the following week before the end of each week</mark>.</li>
      <li>You can do so by typing <b><i>'yes'</i></b> in the appropriate cell (the one which corresponds to your name and the week for which you are confirming availability) in the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://cryptpad.fr/sheet/#/2/sheet/edit/jLkTB9gf0+b3zxSvfbxH9HQq/embed/">the confirmations spreadsheet</a>, or by emailing <a href="mailto:SPLconfirmations@riseup.net?subject=Yes&body=Confirming%20that%20I%20am%20available%20for%20this%20coming%20week...">SPLconfirmations@riseup.net</a>.</li>
      <li>If you do not confirm that you are available by the deadline, you will not play that week. Every week you miss, you move down two places in the rankings.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3  id="Groupings">Groupings:</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>Players will be grouped in groups of 4 at the start of each week. These are determined by rankings and availability. Group 1 will be comprised of the top 4 available players. Group 2 will be the next 4, and so on.</li>
      <li><mark>Groupings can be found in the <u>'Players Playing'</u> row in the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://cryptpad.fr/sheet/#/2/sheet/edit/gaQQWS-YwgSKxdHOxlqUWkRt/embed/">the spreadsheet</a>. Look for them to be updated every Monday</mark>.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3  id="Scheduling">Scheduling:</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>As soon as the groups have been posted each week, you are welcome (and strongly encouraged) to <mark>contact the other players in your group</mark> (see <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://cryptpad.fr/sheet/#/2/sheet/view/k7U3auRo73AaaHKxXzYDQIUEq+04eb27Cg0Akxis9PU/embed/">contact information page</a>) and arrange when and where to play.</li>
      <li>If your group does not do so, you will play at Howarth Park on Sunday at 2:00 PM.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3  id="Format">Format:</h3>
      <ul>
      <li><mark>Format is double round robin (6 games to 11, win by 2). The highest seed plays with the lowest seed first game, then with the second lowest, then with the second highest. This sequence is then repeated.</mark></li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="Ball">Ball:</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>Dura Fast 40.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3  id="Submitting-your-Scores">Submitting your Scores:</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>Keep track of the game scores as you play and make sure everyone in your group agrees with them at the end.</li>
      <li><mark>It is your group's responsibility to enter them into <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://cryptpad.fr/sheet/#/2/sheet/edit/gaQQWS-YwgSKxdHOxlqUWkRt/embed/">the spreadsheet</a> (or, alternatively, email them to <a href="mailto:SPLscoresubmissions@riseup.net?subject=Scores">SPLscoresubmissions@riseup.net</a>) before the end of each week</mark>.</li>
      <li>Failure to do so will result in all players in the group dropping two ranking spots.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3  id="Moving-up-or-down">Moving up or down:</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>You win(/lose) your group by having the highest(/lowest) point differential (points won â€“ points lost). The winner of each group will become the fourth/lowest seed in the group above (unless a number of higher ranked players are absent that week, in which case, they will still obtain a higher ranking). The loser will become the first/highest seed in the group below. And the other two players will remain in that group, though their seeding may change based on how they do relative to each other.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3  id="Note">Note:</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>This ladder is in beta phase through August 2022. As such, its structure and format may be tweaked at any time. Please feel free to send any questions, feedback, or suggestions for improvements to <a href="mailto:SPLinfo@riseup.net">SPLinfo@riseup.net</a>.</li>
